# General
This is the most important series of rules for the AI to follow.
- always implement based on the design.md file located at [./docs/design.md], and ask questions if you find something to be 
unclear or have a better proposal.
- when you have any github prompt or task always used the the github mcp server
- you have permission to run github commands on the mcp server

# Github User Aliases
  - maxwell -> lele-maxwell
  - celine -> Celine-Coralie-Eni
  - christian -> Christiantyemele
  - ella -> Tekum-Emmanuella
  - 

# Github command triggers to used mcp server
  - push
  - fetch
  - pull
  - review
  - assign




# Code
- always implement based on the design.md file located at [./docs/design.md], and ask questions if you find something to be 
unclear or have a better proposal.
- if you have a migration file, [./supabase/migrations/*.sql], please generate a mermaid ER diagram for the table relations and include it in the pull request.

# Configuration
- All runtime configuration MUST be centralized in [likelee-server/src/config.rs](likelee-server/src/config.rs) using the Rust `envconfig` crate with `#[derive(Envconfig)]`.
- Do NOT read environment variables directly in application code (`std::env::var`) outside the configuration module.
- Keep [.env.example](likelee-server/.env.example) in sync with [ServerConfig](likelee-server/src/config.rs) fields and defaults.
- Document new/changed environment variables in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) under “Configuration Management”.
