  "faqMultipleCampaignsTitle": "Can I hire the same talent for multiple campaigns?",
  "faqMultipleCampaignsDescription": "Yes. If a creator's contract allows renewal, you can re-book them at the same rates (or renegotiate). Most creators prefer repeat work.",
  "faqRevisionsTitle": "What if I need revisions?",
  "faqRevisionsDescription": "Revisions are project-to-project based on what's agreed upfront. Minor tweaks are usually included. Major scope changes = new project with new pricing.",
  "faqApprovalTimeTitle": "How long does approval take?",
  "faqApprovalTimeDescription": "Most creators respond within 24 hours. Some respond within hours. Urgency is factored into pricing (faster turnaround = higher price, usually).",
  "faqGuaranteedDeliverablesTitle": "Can you guarantee deliverables?",
  "faqGuaranteedDeliverablesDescription": "Talent is incentivized to deliver (they don't get paid the 50% on completion if they don't). If they fail to deliver, we help you find replacement talent or issue a refund.",

  "faqFormatsDescription": "Whatever you request: MP4, MOV, ProRes, social-optimized cuts, etc. Specify in the brief.",
  "faqExceedLicensedTimeframeTitle": "What if I exceed the licensed timeframe?",
  "faqExceedLicensedTimeframeDescription": "You can renew the license by re-contracting with the talent. Renewal is usually 20–30% of original project cost.",
  "faqVerifiedConsentTitle": "Is this verified consent?",
  "faqVerifiedConsentDescription": "Yes. Every talent on Likelee has verified their likeness rights. Contracts are SAG-AFTRA-aligned. You're protected.",

  "faqUnauthorizedUseDescription": "Watermarks + automated DMCA takedowns. We scan the web and issue takedowns automatically.",

  "faces.faq.questions.0.title": "What is a \"Creator\"?",
  "faces.faq.questions.0.description": "A Creator is any verified individual licensing their likeness (face, voice, or digital twin) for campaigns or AI-assisted productions. You keep ownership of your image; Likelee only facilitates licensed use under your chosen terms.",
  "faces.faq.questions.1.title": "How do I get verified?",
  "faces.faq.questions.1.description": "After your account is granted into the ecosystem, you'll receive a welcome email and verification link. You'll submit ID and a short selfie video so our system can confirm your authenticity and produce your cameo.",
  "faces.faq.questions.2.title": "Can my likeness be used without consent?",
  "faces.faq.questions.2.description": "Never. Each usage request requires your explicit approval. No brand, studio, or AI partner can use your likeness unless you've granted permission for that specific context.",
  "faces.faq.questions.3.title": "Can I remove my likeness from the platform?",
  "faces.faq.questions.3.description": "Yes. You can deactivate or delete your profile anytime. Existing active licences will expire automatically at the end of their contractual term, and no new usages can occur.",
  "faces.faq.questions.4.title": "What if a brand asks for \"in perpetuity\" rights?",
  "faces.faq.questions.4.description": "Likelee does not allow perpetual-use clauses by default. If you choose to accept one, you'll be shown a clear warning about what it means and can negotiate higher compensation or decline.",
  "faces.faq.questions.5.title": "Can my likeness be used to train AI models?",
  "faces.faq.questions.5.description": "Only if you explicitly enable the \"AI training rights\" option. This is disabled by default. You'll always see a disclosure when a campaign involves generative or synthetic use.",
  "faces.faq.questions.6.title": "What protections exist if my likeness is misused?",
  "faces.faq.questions.6.description": "Likelee tracks every approved asset and maintains digital proofs. If misuse occurs, our rights-enforcement team assists you with takedowns and documentation for legal follow-up.",
  "faces.faq.questions.7.title": "Do I still own my digital likeness?",
  "faces.faq.questions.7.description": "Yes. You retain full ownership. You're licensing usage, not transferring ownership. All digital replicas remain tied to your verified identity.",
  "faces.faq.questions.8.title": "Can I negotiate rates for different types of usage?",
  "faces.faq.questions.8.description": "Absolutely. You can set separate pricing for human-recorded UGC, AI cameos, and full AI digital twins. Our system auto-applies your chosen rate based on campaign type and duration.",

Everything unfolds in its own time, and that's perfectly okay.",
